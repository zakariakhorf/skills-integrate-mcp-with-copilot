# Issue: Frontend UI plan (optional)

**Summary**
Plan a minimal frontend (React/Next.js or plain HTML) to allow browsing activities, signing up, and admin views for events and members.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Create a small Next.js app skeleton or a few static pages that call the API for: listing activities, viewing activity details, signing up.
- Document the UI routes and main components needed.
- Optionally create a simple design prototype link or screenshots.
